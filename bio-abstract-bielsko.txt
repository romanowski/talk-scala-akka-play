Abstract:

Scala: Ecosystem where developers flourish

This talk is aimed as quick introduction to Scala and its ecosystem. It will start with Scala itself through web frameworks just to end at most exiting scala-related frameworks such as Akka and Spark. I will try to show you Scala that is simple and intuitive. I promise there will be no Hight Math (no Monads!) or 20 kinds of types involved (unless I am asked about it).
